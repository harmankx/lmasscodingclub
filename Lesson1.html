						<h3>Installing the JDK</h3>
						<div class="section">
							<p id="lesson">
		              To begin programming in Java, we must first setup our computer
									to be able to run and understand Java. To do this, we must
									install the Java Development Kit (JDK). Think of this as a
									dictionary you are giving your computer to read, and understand
									your code! Let's start by clicking the image on the right to get
									to the Java website!

		              download page for the JDK. Once you are there, there will be

						<h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>
						<div class="section">
							<p id="lesson">
		              Now that our computer understands Java, we need a way to write code,
									and pass it on to the computer so they can read it! To do this we will
									install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called Eclipse. Just
									click the Eclipse logo on the right, and it will take you to the download
									page for Eclipse. Just press the download button, the press the download
									button on the next page to install Eclipse!
